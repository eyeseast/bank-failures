# Git scraper template

Use this for simple git scrapers that download and track files over time.

In `.github/workflows/update.yml`, update two environment variables:

- `env.ENDPOINT`: Fetch this endpoint to download data.
- `env.TARGET`: Save data here.

Update this README as needed to describe what's happening.
